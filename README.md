Exercises from 4 week C bootcamp as a part of application process to Codam (Coding College Amsterdam).
Every work day we had new topics, for example, dynamic memory allocation or later linked lists, and corresponding practical exercises. Folders named "dXX" contain pdf with exercises for the day and my programs. In addition, we had exams every Friday (see "examX" folders)and rush projects in groups over the weekends(see rushXX folders).
